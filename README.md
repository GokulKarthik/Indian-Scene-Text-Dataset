# Indian-Language-Recognition-Dataset

The Indian language text recognition dataset has been compiled as part of the work towards [Indian Signboard Translation Project](https://ai4bharat.org/articles/sign-board) by [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/). The project involves threes modular tasks:
1. **Text Detection:** Detecting bounding boxes containing text in the images
2. **Text Recognition:** Getting the text from the detected crop 
3. **Translation:** Translating text from one Indian language to other Indian language

## Detection & Recognition Dataset 
 [Shubham Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhampateliet/) and [Jaya Ingle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inglejaya95/) have synthetically generated the [Indian language text detection & recognition dataset](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1hnNxuHbBBZrrI7Ee6FePTsUfW97qrJAS) based on [SynthText](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/) while at IIT Madras. This synthetic detection & recognition dataset is a collection of images where in word instances of specific Indian languages are placed over natural scences. Each image has a corresponding annotation csv file that lists the bounding box coordinates for each word instance in that image. Check the sample images in that dataset below: 
Sample - Tamil            |  Sample - Hindi
